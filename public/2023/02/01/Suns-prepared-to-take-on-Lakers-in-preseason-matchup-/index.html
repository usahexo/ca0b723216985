            <h1 id="Suns-prepared-to-take-on-Lakers-in-preseason-matchup"><a href="#Suns-prepared-to-take-on-Lakers-in-preseason-matchup" class="headerlink" title="Suns prepared to take on Lakers in preseason matchup"></a>Suns prepared to take on Lakers in preseason matchup</h1><p>The Los Angeles Lakers will travel to Phoenix for a preseason game against the Suns on Sunday. </p>
<p>The Suns have been preparing for the matchup, hoping to give their fans a glimpse of what they can expect this season. </p>
<p>“I think it’s important that we come out and put on a good show,” said Devin Booker. “I know the fans are excited and we’re excited as well.” </p>
<p>Booker and the Suns will face off against a Lakers team that features LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The two superstars teamed up this offseason, and the Lakers are expected to be one of the top teams in the Western Conference this season. </p>
<p>Phoenix is hoping to improve on last season’s performance, when they finished with a 19-63 record. They made some additions to their roster this offseason, including Ricky Rubio and Aron Baynes. </p>
<p>“I love our team,” said Suns head coach Monty Williams. “We’ve got some versatile guys, we’ve got some high IQ guys, so I like where we’re at.” </p>
<p>Sunday’s game is scheduled for 6:00 PM PT and will be televised on ESPN.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-read-through-charts-for-sports-betting-Phoenix-Suns"><a href="#How-to-read-through-charts-for-sports-betting-Phoenix-Suns" class="headerlink" title="How to read through charts for sports betting Phoenix Suns"></a>How to read through charts for sports betting Phoenix Suns</h1><p>In order to make money betting on sports, you need to be able to read the charts. This means being able to identify trends and patterns in the data, so that you can place your bets with confidence. In this article, we’ll show you how to read through charts for Phoenix Suns games.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll want to do is take a look at the team’s overall performance. You can do this by looking at their win&#x2F;loss record or their point differential. In general, you’ll want to bet on teams that are playing well and against teams that are playing poorly.</p>
<p>You can also look at the team’s home&#x2F;away splits. Home teams generally have an advantage over away teams, so if one team is significantly better at home than on the road, that could be a good betting opportunity.</p>
<p>You can also look at how well each player is performing. This information is usually available in the form of per-game averages or percentages. If a player is having a great game, their odds of winning will be higher than usual. Conversely, if a player is having a bad game, their odds of losing will be higher than usual.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll want to take into account the matchup between the two teams. This includes looking at both the offensive and defensive ratings of each team. You can also look at other factors such as past results or injuries. All these factors together will give you a good idea of who is likely to win and who is likely to lose.</p>
<h1 id="Suns-aiming-to-rebound-after-NBA-Playoffs-elimination"><a href="#Suns-aiming-to-rebound-after-NBA-Playoffs-elimination" class="headerlink" title="Suns aiming to rebound after NBA Playoffs elimination"></a>Suns aiming to rebound after NBA Playoffs elimination</h1><p>Phoenix Suns general manager Ryan McDonough is eyeing a rebound next season after the team was eliminated in the NBA Playoffs’ opening round. </p>
<p>“I think we’re all pretty upset about what happened,” McDonough said Saturday at the team’s end-of-season press conference. “We felt like we had a team that was good enough to win a playoff series and we didn’t do that. I think it stings for everybody, especially the players. They put in so much work and they want to win and experience postseason success. We fell short of our goal this year so I think there’s definitely a bit of hunger and motivation to get back there as soon as possible.” </p>
<p>The Suns were one game away from knocking off the sixth-seeded Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, but ultimately lost three straight games to end their 2018-19 season. </p>
<p>McDonough said improving Phoenix’s defense will be a top priority for the offseason. The Suns allowed 112.5 points per game during the regular season, ranking 26th in the league. </p>
<p>“Our defense has got to improve, bottom line,” McDonough said. “We have to be better on that end of the floor if we want to take another step forward as a franchise. We can score with just about anybody in this league but we have to get stops in order to be an elite team and take it up another notch in terms of wins and losses. That will be a major focus for us this summer – trying to improve our roster defensively across the board. Whether that means upgrading at one or two positions or changing the style of play or adding some new players that fit that mold, I think that will be among our highest priorities going into free agency and into next season.” </p>
<p>McDonough also said he plans on giving Devin Booker more opportunities to run the offense next season now that Isaiah Thomas is no longer with the team. Booker averaged 24.9 points and 6.6 assists during his fourth season in Phoenix. </p>
<p>Other members of Phoenix’s young core – including Deandre Ayton, Josh Jackson and Mikal Bridges – are also expected to play bigger roles next season after gaining valuable experience during their first taste of postseason action. </p>
<p>The Suns finished with a record of 39-43 this season and will enter 2019-20 with plenty of optimism amid heightened expectations from their fan base</p>
<h1 id="Booker-looking-to-lead-Suns-back-to-playoffs"><a href="#Booker-looking-to-lead-Suns-back-to-playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Booker looking to lead Suns back to playoffs"></a>Booker looking to lead Suns back to playoffs</h1><p>Phoenix Suns shooting guard Devin Booker is looking to lead the team back to the playoffs for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>Booker, who is entering his fourth season in the NBA, averaged 24.9 points and 4.7 assists per game last year. He also shot 38 percent from three-point range.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about this season,” Booker said at Suns media day on Monday. “We have a lot of new talent and I think we can make some noise in the Western Conference.”</p>
<p>The Suns did not make any major moves in free agency, but they did add some talented young players to their roster, including rookie center Deandre Ayton and veteran small forward Trevor Ariza.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of depth this year,” Booker said. “I think we can compete with anyone in the West.”</p>
<p>The Suns open their season on Wednesday night against the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
<h1 id="Suns-kicking-off-preseason-against-Lakers"><a href="#Suns-kicking-off-preseason-against-Lakers" class="headerlink" title="Suns kicking off preseason against Lakers"></a>Suns kicking off preseason against Lakers</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns will kick off the preseason against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 1. This matchup is sure to be exciting, as both teams are looking to improve on their 2018-2019 campaigns.</p>
<p>The Lakers have made several big moves in the offseason, most notably acquiring superstar forward LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers. With James in tow, the Lakers are considered one of the favorites to win the NBA championship this season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Suns have been relatively quiet in free agency, but they still have a talented roster led by guards Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. Phoenix will hope to surprise some people this season and make a run for the playoffs.</p>
<p>It should be an enjoyable game to watch, with plenty of highlights in store. Who will come out on top? Tune in on October 1 to find out.</p>

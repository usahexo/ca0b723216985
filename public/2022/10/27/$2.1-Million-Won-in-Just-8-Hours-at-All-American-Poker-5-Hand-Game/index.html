The game was hosted at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas and it saw some very big wins, with the biggest one being worth $503,000.</p>
<p>The game is quite simple – each player is dealt five cards and then has to make the best possible five-card hand using any combination of their cards. The ace is always high and the two is always low, so there are a total of 21 possible combinations. There are four rounds of betting and then the best hand takes down the pot.</p>
<p>There were 52 players who took part in the game on Sunday and it was eventually won by a player known as “PioSanto”. He managed to take down a huge pot of $503,000 thanks to a royal flush which was made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of diamonds. This was by far the biggest win of the day and it propelled him to first place in the overall standings.</p>
<p>The runner-up for the day was “luckboxlv” who walked away with $294,000 after making a royal flush of his own. This was definitely an impressive feat and it helped him to move up from second place overall to first place in just 8 hours. There were plenty of other big winners on the day too, including “PeruvianPrincess” who won $187,000 and “NeonDeion” who won $172,000.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an extremely successful day for poker players at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and there will no doubt be many more big winners in coming weeks and months. The popularity of All American Poker 5 seems to be only increasing with each passing day so don’t be surprised if you see even bigger pots being played in the near future!</p>

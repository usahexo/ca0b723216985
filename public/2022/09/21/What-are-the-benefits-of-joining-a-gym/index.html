            <h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-joining-a-gym"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-joining-a-gym" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of joining a gym?"></a>What are the benefits of joining a gym?</h1><p>There are many benefits of joining a gym. The biggest benefit is that you will get in shape. You can also meet new friends at the gym. Gyms have many different types of equipment, so you can find the perfect workout for you. Gyms also offer classes, which can help you learn new exercises and stay motivated. If you are having trouble meeting your fitness goals, a personal trainer can help you get on track. Joining a gym is a great way to improve your health and your lifestyle.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-average-monthly-cost-of-a-gym-membership"><a href="#What-is-the-average-monthly-cost-of-a-gym-membership" class="headerlink" title="What is the average monthly cost of a gym membership?"></a>What is the average monthly cost of a gym membership?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question since the cost of a gym membership can vary widely depending on the location, the type of facility, and the amenities offered. However, according to Statista, the average monthly cost for a U.S. gym membership in 2017 was $58.80.</p>
<p>There are many different factors you’ll want to consider when choosing a gym membership. First, decide what type of facility you’re looking for. There are full-service gyms that offer a wide range of exercise equipment and classes, or there are specialty gyms such as those focused on weightlifting or Pilates. If you’re new to working out, a full-service gym might be a better option since they offer more comprehensive programming.</p>
<p>Next, think about your budget and what amenities are important to you. Many gyms offer discounts if you sign up for multiple months or if you agree to automatic billing through your bank account or credit card. Be sure to compare prices between different facilities in your area before signing up.</p>
<p>Finally, take into account the location and hours of the gyms near you. You’ll want to choose a facility that’s convenient for your schedule and that’s open when you’re available to work out.</p>
<p>All things considered, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is around $60. If that’s within your budget, it’s definitely worth considering investing in one!</p>
<h1 id="How-many-gyms-are-there-in-the-United-States"><a href="#How-many-gyms-are-there-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="How many gyms are there in the United States?"></a>How many gyms are there in the United States?</h1><p>There are over 33,000 gyms in the US as of 2019. This number is constantly growing as the popularity of working out and staying fit increases.</p>
<h1 id="What-percent-of-Americans-belong-to-a-gym"><a href="#What-percent-of-Americans-belong-to-a-gym" class="headerlink" title="What percent of Americans belong to a gym?"></a>What percent of Americans belong to a gym?</h1><p>Americans are largely health conscious individuals, and fitness is a top priority for many of them. This is evidenced by the large percentage of Americans that belong to a gym. In fact, according to Statista, as of January 2017, 33 percent of Americans were members of a gym. That’s a lot of people committed to getting and staying fit!</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why people choose to join a gym. Maybe they want the structure and support that comes with having a regular routine. Maybe they want the social atmosphere that gyms often provide. Or maybe they just like having access to all the equipment they need in one place.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Americans love their gyms! And if you’re thinking about joining one, there’s no time like the present.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-most-popular-type-of-gym"><a href="#What-is-the-most-popular-type-of-gym" class="headerlink" title="What is the most popular type of gym?"></a>What is the most popular type of gym?</h1><p>There are a lot of different types of gyms. You have your traditional gym, which usually has a variety of equipment for people to use. Then you have your boutique fitness studios, which offer unique classes and programs. And finally, you have your CrossFit boxes, which specialize in high-intensity interval training.</p>
<p>So, what is the most popular type of gym?</p>
<p>Based on the number of memberships each type of gym has, it appears that the traditional gym is the most popular type of gym. Boutique fitness studios are growing in popularity, but they still have a ways to go before they overtake the traditional gym. CrossFit boxes are also growing in popularity, but they still don’t have nearly as many members as traditional gyms or boutique fitness studios.</p>

Governor Matt Bevin has announced that the state will join other states in this new industry.</p>
<p>This move is expected to increase tourism and tax revenue for the state. The additional money could be used to improve education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Other states that have allowed sports gambling include New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia.</p>
<h1 id="KYSportsGamblingLegal-Governor-signs-bill-into-law"><a href="#KYSportsGamblingLegal-Governor-signs-bill-into-law" class="headerlink" title="KYSportsGamblingLegal: Governor signs bill into law"></a>KYSportsGamblingLegal: Governor signs bill into law</h1><p>KYSportsGamblingLegal<br> Governor signs bill into law</p>
<p>On Wednesday, May 22nd, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin signed Senate Bill 151 into law, legalizing sports gambling in the state. The law will go into effect on July 14th. Per the new law,Kentucky residents will be allowed to bet on professional and collegiate sports at licensed casinos and racetracks. The minimum age to gamble is 21.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill has been a long time coming for many in the state. In fact, former Kentucky Senator Damon Thayer introduced a similar bill back in 2013. That bill did not pass, but Thayer was confident that the latest attempt would be successful. “This has been a long time coming,” said Thayer. “I’m grateful to my colleagues in the legislature for their support and to Governor Bevin for signing this into law.”</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill believe it will bring much-needed revenue to the state. Kentucky casinos and racetracks are expected to generate $11 million in revenue during the first year of operation and $19 million by 2021. “This is great news for Kentucky’s horse industry and other gaming interests,” said Representative Adam Koenig. “It’s also great news for our taxpayers who will see increased revenue from this industry.”</p>
<p>Opponents of sports gambling argue that it can lead to addictive behavior and social ills. They also maintain that it is a sinfully immoral activity that should not be sanctioned by the government. “Gambling is a scourge on our society,” said Pastor John Spurgeon of Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Frankfort, KY. “It destroys families and damages lives.”</p>
<h1 id="KY-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#KY-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="KY Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Gambling"></a>KY Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Gambling</h1><p>On Wednesday, Kentucky became the latest state to legalize sports gambling. The state’s newly-passed bill allows licensed casinos and racetracks to offer bets on professional and college sporting events.</p>
<p>Kentucky is the fifth state this year to legalize some form of sports gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia. In 2018, seven states passed similar legislation.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Kentucky bill say it will generate much-needed revenue for the state’s struggling casino and racing industries. Critics argue that the legislation will lead to increased addiction and gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>Governor Matt Bevin has said he plans to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Kentucky"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Kentucky" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Now Legal in Kentucky"></a>Sports Gambling Now Legal in Kentucky</h1><p>On Friday, November 8, 2019, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission voted to allow sports gambling at the state’s eight racetracks. The move makes Kentucky the latest state to jump on the sports betting bandwagon, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The commission voted 4-1 in favor of allowing sports wagering at the tracks. Commissioner Sean Patrick said that he believes that legal sports betting will generate new revenue for the horse racing industry in Kentucky. He also believes that it will create jobs and tourism opportunities.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure worry that the addition of sports betting will lead to an increase in gambling addiction and other social ills. However, supporters note that safeguards are in place to prevent such problems. For example, a person must be 21 years old or older to gamble, and track operators will be required to use geolocation technology to ensure that players are within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>In addition, a portion of the revenue generated by sports betting will be used to fund programs aimed at preventing problem gambling.</p>
<p>Governor Matt Bevin has not yet indicated whether he plans to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="KY-Government-Approves-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#KY-Government-Approves-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="KY Government Approves Bill Allowing Sports Betting"></a>KY Government Approves Bill Allowing Sports Betting</h1><p>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - The Kentucky government has approved a bill that would allow sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has stated that it will soon begin accepting applications from race tracks and casinos who want to offer sports betting. The commission plans to start with traditional bets such as who will win a game or how many points will be scored, but may expand to in-game bets and prop bets in the future.</p>
<p>Governor Matt Bevin says that the bill is a “huge win” for Kentucky, and that the additional revenue from sports betting will help the state’s struggling horse racing industry. He also predicts that the new law will create new jobs in the state’s gaming and hospitality industries.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems. They also note that sports betting is currently illegal under federal law, and that there is no guarantee that the federal government won’t step in and shut down Kentucky’s nascent sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill maintain that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that any negative consequences can be mitigated by strong regulations and enforcement. They are confident that Kentucky can become a leading player in the rapidly growing sports betting industry.</p>

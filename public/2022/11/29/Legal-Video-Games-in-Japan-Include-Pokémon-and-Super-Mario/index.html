Pokémon and Super Mario are popular among avid gamers and have been played for many years. Due to the unique gaming culture in Japan, players can purchase games that are unavailable in other countries. While there is no law that prohibits the sale of video games, there are restrictions on the type of video games that can be sold. The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rates video games based on their content and assigns them a rating.</p>
<p>Pokémon is one of the most popular video game franchises that was created in Japan. The first Pokémon video game was released for Game Boy in 1996. Since then, over 20 titles have been released for various platforms including Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The latest title, Pokémon Sun and Moon, was released worldwide in 2016. The objective of the game is to capture wild Pokémon and make them battle against other trainers to become the world’s best Pokémon master.</p>
<p>Super Mario is another iconic video game franchise from Japan that was created by Shigeru Miyamoto in 1985. The first title was released for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and since then, over 200 titles have been released for various platforms including Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Android. The latest title, Super Mario Odyssey, was released worldwide in 2017. In the game, players control Mario as he tries to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser.</p>
<h1 id="Sony-Settles-PlayStation-Battle-Now-All-Formats-of-Gaming-Are-Legal-in-Japan"><a href="#Sony-Settles-PlayStation-Battle-Now-All-Formats-of-Gaming-Are-Legal-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="Sony Settles PlayStation Battle: Now All Formats of Gaming Are Legal in Japan"></a>Sony Settles PlayStation Battle: Now All Formats of Gaming Are Legal in Japan</h1><p>Many gamers rejoiced when the news of Sony’s victory in the PlayStation case made headlines.</p>
<p>This event signaled the end to a long and hard-fought legal battle between Sony and two other companies, who were also selling consoles in Japan at the time.</p>
<p>What does this mean for gamers in Japan?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it means that all formats of gaming are now legal in Japan. This includes both home-console gaming and mobile gaming.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for console gaming in particular?</p>
<p>Well, it means that the market is now open for all console manufacturers to compete in Japan. This is great news for consumers, as it will likely lead to more competitive prices and better deals.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that Nintendo had a significant head start in the Japanese market, and so it may be some time before Sony or any of its rivals can catch up. Nevertheless, this ruling clears the way for them to do so, if they can find a way to appeal to Japanese gamers.</p>
<h1 id="Nintendo-Strikes-Back-Wii-and-3DS-Games-are-Now-Legal-in-Japan"><a href="#Nintendo-Strikes-Back-Wii-and-3DS-Games-are-Now-Legal-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Strikes Back: Wii and 3DS Games are Now Legal in Japan"></a>Nintendo Strikes Back: Wii and 3DS Games are Now Legal in Japan</h1><p>Nintendo just announced that it will be selling certain Wii and 3DS games in Japan starting on March 20th.</p>
<p>This move is a reversal of the company’s earlier decision to ban those games due to new online gambling laws in the country.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point which games will be made available again, but Nintendo has stated that it is working to make as many of its popular titles available as possible.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after a series of setbacks for Nintendo in Japan, including the shutdown of two popular mobile games last year.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s back on track!  After the fiasco with their mobile apps being shut down, they’ve decided to bring back some Wii and 3DS games to sell in Japan starting from March 20th! The specific games that will be available haven’t been confirmed yet, but they’re probably aiming to release most of their best-selling titles again. This is great news for all Nintendo fans - let’s hope they can keep up the momentum!</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Can-and-Cannot-Play-Legally-in-Japan-A-Guide-to-Video-Games"><a href="#What-You-Can-and-Cannot-Play-Legally-in-Japan-A-Guide-to-Video-Games" class="headerlink" title="What You Can and Cannot Play Legally in Japan: A Guide to Video Games"></a>What You Can and Cannot Play Legally in Japan: A Guide to Video Games</h1><p>Japan has a complex and ever-changing set of laws regulating the sale and play of video games. Here is a general guide to what is (and isn’t) legal in Japan when it comes to video games.</p>
<p>The basic rule is that any game with adult content (i.e. sexual content or violence) is illegal to sell or rent to minors. This applies to games for all platforms, including consoles, mobile devices, and PCs.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, games that are rated CERO Z (for ages 18 and up) or above can be legally sold to minors. These games typically have very explicit sexual or violent content, so parents should be aware of the content before purchasing them for their children.</p>
<p>Games that are not rated by CERO (such as unrated imports from abroad) are technically illegal to sell or rent to minors, but this law is rarely enforced. In fact, many stores openly sell unrated games to anyone who wants them.</p>
<p>There are also some exceptions for games that contain minimal amounts of adult content. For example, it is legal to sell and rent games like “Call of Duty” and “Assassin’s Creed” to minors, even though they contain violence. This is because these games do not have enough explicit content to warrant an adult rating from CERO.</p>
<p>With that said, there are a few things to keep in mind when playing video games in Japan:</p>
<p>-Many mobile games and PC titles are not rated by CERO, so they may contain more explicit content than you expect. Be sure to read the game’s description before buying or playing it.</p>
<p>-Console games released in Japan typically have higher age ratings than their overseas counterparts. For example, the Japanese version of “Metal Gear Solid V” is rated CERO D (ages 17 and up), while the US version is rated M for mature audiences only. Be sure to check the rating before purchasing or playing console games.</p>
<h1 id="The-Laws-on-Gaming-in-Japan-What-You-Need-to-Know"><a href="#The-Laws-on-Gaming-in-Japan-What-You-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="The Laws on Gaming in Japan: What You Need to Know"></a>The Laws on Gaming in Japan: What You Need to Know</h1><p>Japan is a country that has a love for gaming. From the arcade games of the early 80s to the current global phenomenon of mobile gaming, Japan has always been on the forefront of new and exciting ways to play games.</p>
<p>This love for gaming has also led to some interesting laws and regulations surrounding gaming in Japan. If you are planning on visiting or moving to Japan, it’s important to be aware of these laws so that you don’t accidentally break any rules and end up with a criminal record.</p>
<p>The first law that you need to be aware of is the Gaming Law, which was enacted in 1948. This law prohibits gambling activities except for those that are specifically authorised by the government. This includes activities such as casinos, horse racing, and pachinko parlours.</p>
<p>However, there is one form of gambling that is legal in Japan even though it is not specifically authorised by the government. This is called daifugo, which is a type of lottery where players use special tiles to try and create specific patterns. The winner is the person who completes their pattern first and they can then choose one of three prize options: a cash prize, a trip, or merchandise.</p>
<p>The second law that you need to be aware of is the Youth Healthy Development Law, which was passed in 2000. This law prohibits minors from playing games that are considered harmful to their development. This includes games with violent or sexual content, as well as games that can cause addiction or lead to social isolation.</p>
<p>There are a few exemptions from this law, including educational games and games played in supervised settings such as schools or arcades. However, parents are still responsible for ensuring their children are not playing harmful games, even if they are exempt from the Youth Healthy Development Law.</p>
<p>The third law that you need to be aware of is the Copyright Law, which was enacted in 2006. This law prohibits the unauthorised reproduction or distribution of copyrighted materials, including digital content such as video games. This means that you cannot make illegal copies of video games or share them online without permission from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>There are some exemptions from this law, such as making copies for personal use or creating backups for data security purposes. However, it is still important to check with the copyright holders before making any copies of video games – especially if you plan on sharing them online.</p>

#  Dealer Hits Twice, Loses to Player in Blackjack Game

In a blackjack game dealt at a casino, the dealer hit twice on 16 and lost to the player in blackjack. This is an unusual occurrence, as the dealer is typically expected to win when hitting on 16.

The reason for this particular discrepancy is that the dealer had a bad run of cards. In blackjack, the dealer's hand is made up of two cards, and the player's hand is made up of two cards. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player can hit (draw another card) or stand (end play). If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the hand.

In this particular game, the dealer had two low cards—a 2 and a 3—while the player had two high cards—an Ace and a King. When the dealer hit on 16, they were likely hoping for another low card so they could stay in the game. However, they instead received an 8, which pushed their total to 24. At this point, they were already likely to lose since the player's total was 20.

The next card drawn was another low number—a 2—which meant that the dealer lost to the player even though they hit twice. This unusual outcome can be chalked up to sheer bad luck on behalf of the dealer.

#  Dealer Hits Four Times and Loses in Blackjack Game 

In Blackjack, dealers are not supposed to hit on 17 or greater. But what happens when they do? 

Dealer Hits Four Times and Loses in Blackjack Game 

Recently, there was a blackjack game where the dealer hit on 17 four times and lost each time. This is an extremely rare occurrence, but it does happen from time to time. 

There are a few things that could have led to this happening. It is possible that the dealer was dealt a bad hand and had no other choice but to hit. It is also possible that the players at the table were making wise decisions and winning most of the hands. As a result, the dealer may have ended up with very few options by the end of the game. 

Whatever the reason may be, it is always interesting to see something like this happen at a blackjack table. It just goes to show that anything can happen in this game, and you never know what you might end up seeing.

#  Dealer Hits Five Times and Loses in Blackjack Game 

In a blackjack game at a Las Vegas casino, the dealer had a five showing on the first two cards he dealt to himself. He hit again and got another five, for a total of 10. Hoping for a third five, he hit again and got a two. His final total was 12, busting and costing him the game.

This dealer's experience is not unusual. The advantage in blackjack comes from the fact that the player can bust and still lose only half his bet, while the dealer must draw until reaching at least 17 and can bust at any time. This means that the player has about a one-in-four chance of losing no matter what he does, while the dealer has only about a one-in-six chance of winning. In this particular case, the dealer's chances were reduced even further by his poor choices when he had good cards.

Casinos make money by taking in more money from losing players than they pay out to winning players. This means that they are happy to see someone like the dealer in our story lose his money - even though he was playing correctly according to the rules of blackjack.

#  Dealer Hits Six Times and Wins in Blackjack Game 

In a blackjack game, a dealer hit six times in a row and still managed to win the game. This is an extremely rare event, but it is possible. The following is a description of what would have happened in order for the dealer to win after hitting six times in a row.

If you are playing at a casino, the odds of the dealer hitting six times in a row are about 1 in 21 million. This means that it is very unlikely that this will happen, but it is possible. In order for the dealer to win after hitting six times in a row, the player would have had to have gone bust on the sixth hit. This means that their card total would have been over 21, which results in an automatic loss.

There are several ways that the player could have gone bust on the sixth hit. For example, if they had two cards with values of 10 and another card with a value of 2, then their card total would be 22. This would be over 21 and would result in an automatic loss. Another way that the player could have gone bust on the sixth hit is if they had three cards with values of 10. In this case, their card total would be 30 and this would also be over 21, resulting in an automatic loss.

While it is very unlikely that the dealer will hit six times in a row and still manage to win, it is possible. If you are playing at a casino, be sure to know the odds of this happening so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to continue playing.

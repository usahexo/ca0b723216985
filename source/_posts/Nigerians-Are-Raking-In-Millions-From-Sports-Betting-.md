#  Nigerians Are Raking In Millions From Sports Betting 

A recent report by a payment company in Nigeria has shown that Nigerians are making millions from sports betting. The report, which was released by Interswitch, showed that Nigerians spent N4.6 billion on sports betting in the first half of 2018.

This is a significant increase from the N3.5 billion spent on sports betting in the same period in 2017. It is also worth noting that the amount spent on sports betting in the first half of 2018 is more than the amount spent on online shopping (N3.3 billion) and movie tickets (N2.3 billion) in Nigeria during the same period.

Interswitch attributed the growth in sports betting to the increasing number of people who are using their mobile phones to place bets. Mobile phone usage is growing rapidly in Nigeria, and this is especially true among young people.

Many Nigerians see sports betting as a way to make money quickly and easily. Some people even bet on matches that they have no interest in simply because they believe that they can make a lot of money from it.

The fact that many people are making a lot of money from sports betting has led to some problems. For example, there have been reports of people borrowing money from friends and family members so that they can place bets.

Some people have also lost lots of money through sports betting. This has led to anger and frustration, as well as serious financial problems for some people.

Despite these problems, the fact remains that many Nigerians are making lots of money from sports betting. This is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, as more and more people get into it.

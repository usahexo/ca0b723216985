"To win, you'll need to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you beat the dealer, you'll get paid out depending on the odds shown at the top of the screen. So, it's important to make sure you gamble wisely and know when to fold!"

#  Want to make some extra cash? Olympiacos striker Pape Diamande tells all on how to casino blackjack on the club's new app!

I remember when I first started playing casino blackjack. It was just after I had joined Olympiacos and before I had really made a name for myself in the world of professional football. I was young, naive and looking for a quick way to make some extra cash.

It didn't take me long to learn the basics of the game and soon I was making a small profit each week. And now, after years of experience, I'm here to share my tips with you!

# 1: Know the basic rules
Casino blackjack is a simple enough game to understand but there are a few basic rules that you need to know before you start playing. The aim of the game is to score more points than the dealer without going over 21. You can achieve this by drawing cards (up to a total of 21), or by staying on your starting hand total (the amount you were dealt at the beginning of the hand).

If your hand goes over 21, then you bust and automatically lose the hand. If the dealer goes over 21, then all players still in the hand win their bets! The other key rule to remember is that blackjack (a two card hand with an Ace) pays out 3:2 on your bet, so it's always worth aiming for where possible.

# 2: Choose your bets wisely
When you're starting out, it's important to choose your bets wisely. Don't go throwing your hard earned cash away on high stakes games until you've got a good understanding of how the game works. Start off by betting small amounts on lower stakes tables and work your way up as you become more confident.

Remember, casino blackjack is all about risk and reward. So make sure you're comfortable with the risks associated with each bet before placing them. There's nothing worse than losing money through poor decision making!

# 3: Use basic strategy charts
Basic strategy charts can be really helpful when it comes to making decisions during a casino blackjack game. These charts outline the best plays to make depending on the cards that are displayed in your hand. By using a chart as a guide, you can quickly make informed decisions that could help improve your chances of winning!

You can find basic strategy charts online or in books dedicated to casino blackjack. Or if you're feeling really confident, why not try creating your own chart tailored specifically to the games you play? The more knowledgeable you are about the game, the better equipped you'll be to win!

With the onset of the new football season, it’s time for fans of Olympiacos to get their fix of the latest action by downloading the club’s official app.

One of the main features of the app is a blackjack game that allows users to stake money and win prizes. The game is based on real-life casino blackjack, so it offers a realistic experience for fans of the game. In order to help you make the most of your chances of winning at blackjack on the Olympiacos app, we caught up with Andreas Bouchalakis – one of our star midfielders – to ask him for some tips.

Here’s what he had to say:

1. Always choose a blackjack table with lower stakes

The first thing to remember when playing blackjack on the Olympiacos app is that you should always aim to play at tables with lower stakes. This will give you a better chance of winning prizes without risking too much money.

2. Always stick to basic strategy

In order to improve your chances of winning at blackjack on the Olympiacos app, it’s important to stick to basic strategy. This involves making mathematically correct decisions about when to hit, stand, double down or split your cards. If you follow basic strategy, you’ll give yourself a good chance of beating the dealer every time.

3. Practice makes perfect!

The final piece of advice from Andreas Bouchalakis is to practice as much as possible before playing for real money on the Olympiacos app. This way, you’ll be well prepared and more likely to win some prizes!

#  Get ahead of the competition by learning all the secrets of blackjack on the Olympiacos app from our very own players!

The Olympiacos app is a great way to learn all the secrets of blackjack and get ahead of the competition. Our very own players have shared their tips and tricks, so you can start winning big!

Some of the basic tips for playing blackjack include knowing when to call, when to fold and when to take another card. You should also remember that, in general, blackjack is a game of patience – it’s important to stick to a plan and not get carried away by the heat of the moment.

If you want to up your chances of winning even further, here are some more advanced tips:

1) Always split pairs of eights and aces. This increases your chances of getting two winning hands.

2) Never split 5s or 10s. This decreases your chances of winning by half.

3) If the dealer has an ace showing, take another card if you have 11 or less. If you have 12 or more, stand pat (i.e. don’t take any more cards). This increases your chances of winning without going over 21.

4) If the dealer has a six showing, hit if you have 16 or less. If you have 17 or more, stand pat. This gives you a better chance of not going over 21 than if you hit every time.

5) Remember that it’s always better to be two steps ahead of the dealer – think about what they might do next and how that will impact on your hand. For example, if they have a six showing and you have 16, would it be better to hit or stand? By thinking ahead like this, you can make better decisions and increase your chances of winning!

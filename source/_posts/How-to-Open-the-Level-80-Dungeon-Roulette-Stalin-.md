#  How to Open the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin 

The Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin is a player-versus-environment (PVE) dungeon that becomes available at level 80. The dungeon can be played on Normal or Heroic mode, and awards better loot and experience the higher the difficulty.

Normal mode is recommended for players who are undergeared or new to dungeon running, while Heroic mode is better suited for players who are geared and experienced.

To open the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin, speak to Kolya Patrashku in the city of Orsha. He's located just south of the entrance to the main building.

Kolya will offer you a choice of three dungeons to run: The Crematorium, The Slaughterhouse, and The Bunker. Just click on your desired dungeon and you'll be teleported inside.

#  How to Start the Dungeon Roulette Stalin Level 80 
Dungeon Roulette Stalin is a new game for iOS and Android that randomizes dungeons and loot each time you play. This makes it challenging and fun each time you play, as you never know what you'll get. The game is free to download and play, with in-app purchases available.

When you first start the game, there are a few basic pointers on how to play. You can either touch and drag the character to move around, or use the virtual joystick on the left side of the screen. The goal is to navigate your way through the dungeon and find the exit, while fighting enemies and looting treasure chests along the way.

If you die in the dungeon, don't worry – you'll just respawn back at the beginning. However, if you run out of health points, then it's Game Over and you'll have to start again from scratch. There are also checkpoints in each dungeon, so if you do die, you won't have to start all over again.

Your character has two basic stats: health points (HP) and energy points (EP). HP determines how much damage you can take before dying, while EP is used for attacking enemies and casting spells. You can increase your stats by picking up treasure chests throughout the dungeon. Be careful though – some chests are traps that will reduce your HP or EP instead!

There are many different items and weapons to pick up in the dungeon, including swords, shields, bows, arrows, and magic spells. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses, so choose wisely. You can also equip two items at a time – one for your main hand and one for your off hand.

The game features four different dungeons: Forest of Shadows, Molten Caverns, Frozen Fortress, and Dragon's Lair. Each dungeon has its own set of enemies, puzzles, and treasures to discover. So grab your sword and shield – it's time to enter the dungeon!

#  How to Get Into the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin 

The Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin is a high level dungeon for players around level 80. The dungeon is meant to be challenging, and offers great rewards for those who can complete it. The first step is to gather a team of players who are around the same level. You will also need some strong heals, as there are many difficult bosses in the dungeon.

Once you have a team together, head to the north eastern corner of the map and enter the portal. You will then need to complete a series of quests that will take you deep into the dungeon. Be prepared for some tough fights, as you will face many powerful bosses along the way.

When you finally reach the end of the dungeon, you will face off against Stalin himself. This boss is quite difficult, but if your team is strong enough, you can Defeat him and reap the rewards. Good luck in your quest!

#  How to Play the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin 

Dungeons in Stalin are all about the right mix of players and classes to complete it. If you're looking to play the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin, then you'll want to make sure you have a party that's ready for anything.

The first step is to gather your party. You'll need a tank, a healer, and three DPS players. The tank will need to be able to hold aggro and take damage, the healer will need to keep everyone alive, and the DPS players will need to deal damage fast.

Once you have your party assembled, it's time to head into the dungeon. The Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin can be found in the basement of the White House. Talk to the guard outside and he'll let you in.

Inside, you'll find a room with three doors. The door on the left leads to a dungeon filled with level 70 monsters, the door in the middle leads to a dungeon filled with level 80 monsters, and the door on the right leads to a dungeon filled with level 90 monsters.

Which door you choose is up to you, but selecting the wrong door can mean certain death for your party. So how do you choose which door is right for you?

The easiest way is to use your party's level as a guide. If your party is level 70 or lower, then choose the leftmost door for guaranteed success. If your party is level 80 or higher, then choose either of the other two doors for a greater challenge.

If you're feeling adventurous, though, you can try out the Level 80 Dungeon Roulette Stalin for yourself. Just be warned – it's not for beginners!

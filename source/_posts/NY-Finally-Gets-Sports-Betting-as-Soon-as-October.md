#  NY Finally Gets Sports Betting as Soon as October

The wait is finally over for those in New York who want to place sports bets. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday that the state will offer sports betting starting in October, with four upstate casinos slated to offer the service.

“According to the new law, sports betting will be available at the following locations: Del Lago Resort and Casino in Waterloo; Rivers Casino and Resort in Schenectady; Monticello Casino and Raceway; and Tioga Downs Casino Resort in Nichols,” reports David Somers for WBNG.

Cuomo has been an advocate for legalized sports betting since it was legalized as part of the state budget back in April. The governor had initially wanted mobile sports betting to be available as soon as this summer, but that was vetoed by the state legislature.

Now that a date has been set for upstate casinos to offer sports betting, it will be interesting to see how many people take advantage of the service. There are already a number of offshore operators that cater to New Yorkers, so it’s possible that many people will wait to see how things shake out before risking their money at a local casino.

One thing that is certain is that there will be plenty of excitement surrounding the start of sports betting in New York. Fans of all teams can now place bets on their favorite teams, adding an extra level of excitement to the games. There are sure to be some big winners (and losers) as people start placing their bets.

#  After Years of Delay,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) NY Sports Betting Likely to Start this October

On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state's Gaming Commission had awarded four casino licenses. Three of those licenses were for existing casinos in different regions of the state, but the fourth was for a new "Resort Casino" to be built in the Catskills region. That license went to MGM Resorts, who pledged to invest up to $1 billion in the project.

It's been a long time coming. New York passed a law legalizing sports betting in 2013, but it took until this year for regulations to be hammered out and the licenses to be awarded. And there's still more work to be done before people can actually place bets. The casinos need to build the necessary infrastructure, including Sports Books and online platforms, and they need to ink deals with sports leagues and networks.

But assuming everything goes according to plan, betting should start in October.

The news has sent shares of gaming companies soaring. MGM Resorts stock is up 6% on the news, while Caesars Entertainment (which was awarded a license for an Albany casino) is up 2%. Golden Nugget stock is up 1%.

That's because there's a lot of money at stake. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans bet $150 billion on sports each year, and that $4.7 billion of that takes place in New Jersey alone (thanks to that state's early adoption of sports betting).

There are good reasons for states to get into the sports betting business. For one thing, it can help generate much-needed tax revenue (New York projects that its casino licenses will generate $280 million in annual revenue). It can also help attract tourism dollars (the MGM Catskills project is expected to create 3,000 jobs).

But most importantly, it can help drive down illegal gambling activity. According to one study, up to 60% of all sports bets are placed illegally, which means that billions of dollars are going untaxed and unregulated. legalizing sports betting can help bring some of that business out into the open and ensure that it's being monitored and taxed properly.

#  NY's Sports Betting Era Finally Begins in October

After years of waiting, New Yorkers will finally be able to bet on sports come October. The state Gaming Commission has announced that sports betting will be available at the four upstate commercial casinos starting on October 15th.

The casinos are expected to offer a variety of betting options, including point spreads, moneylines, and over/unders for both professional and college sports games. In addition, bets on major events such as the Super Bowl and the World Cup will also be available.

The casinos are also expected to offer in-game betting, which will allow customers to place bets on individual plays as they happen. This is a popular option in other states that have legalized sports betting, and is expected to be a big hit in New York.

Due to the passage of the state's Gaming Reform Act in 2013, New Yorkers have been eagerly awaiting sports betting to become available at local casinos. The law allows for both online and land-based sports betting, but it has taken awhile for the state to get everything in place.

"We've been waiting for this day for quite some time," said commission spokesman Brad Maione. "We're excited to finally bring this new form of entertainment to New Yorkers."

There is some speculation that sports betting could help revive the casino industry in New York, which has been struggling in recent years. In addition to creating new jobs, it is thought that the added revenue from sports betting will help offset some of the losses suffered by the casinos.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates, but supporters believe that it can be properly regulated and will provide a much-needed boost to the state's economy.

No matter what side of the argument you fall on, there's no doubt that NY's Sports Betting Era is finally upon us!

#  October will be a Month of Changes for NY Sports Bettors

It’s been a while since sports fans in New York have had anything to really get excited about. The Yankees were knocked out of the playoffs early, the Giants and Jets didn’t make the postseason, and even the Knicks and Nets are struggling.

However, things are looking up for New York sports bettors this October. There are a few key matchups on the horizon that could lead to some major payouts for those who know where to look.

The first big game of the month is the World Series. The Yankees may not be in it, but both the Mets and the Dodgers are looking like serious contenders. Betting on either of these teams could provide some nice profits for those who take into account things like home field advantage and momentum.

In addition to the World Series, there are also a few high-profile NFL matchups looming on the horizon. The Giants and Cowboys always provide some good drama, and this year’s edition should be no different. Bets on this game could go either way, but it will be interesting to see how Dak Prescott and Eli Manning stack up against each other.

The final big game of October is an NFC East showdown between the Redskins and Eagles. This is another matchup that could go either way, but Washington is currently favored by three points. With so much at stake, this is definitely a game worth betting on.

#  New York Welcomes legalized Sports Betting in October

After much anticipation, New York finally legalized sports betting in October. This new legislation allows for both online and in-person sports betting at licensed casinos and racetracks throughout the state.

Sports fans can now place bets on their favorite teams, and the industry is expected to generate over $100 million in annual revenue. In addition to the excitement of betting on games, this new law also creates jobs and boosts the economy.

Supporters of the bill believe that it will help reduce illegal gambling, which is currently a $2.7 billion industry in New York. Governor Cuomo praised the new law, stating that it would “transform New York into a national leader in legalized sports betting.”

Casinos and racetracks are already preparing for the influx of customers, and several brands have already announced plans to offer sports betting services. Fans can expect to see a variety of betting options, including point spreads, moneylines, and over/unders.

Sports betting has been legal in other states for many years, but New York is one of the first states to legalize it through legislation. Other states are likely to follow suit, as gambling becomes more mainstream and acceptance grows.

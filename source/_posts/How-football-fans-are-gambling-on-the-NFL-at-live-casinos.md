Basics of NFL Betting

If you're new to betting on NFL games, here are the basics you need to know:

- In order to win a bet on an NFL game, your chosen team must win or lose by less than the point spread.
- The point spread is a number that oddsmakers use to handicap the match-up between two teams. - Bettors can choose between two types of wagers: picking the winner of the game (called "straight up") or picking which team will cover the point spread (called "against the spread" or "ATS"). 
- In order to win a straight up wager, your chosen team must win outright - they cannot lose by more than the point spread. 
- In order to win an ATS wager, your chosen team must either win or lose by less than the point spread. If they cover the point spread, you win your wager. 
- The odds vary depending on which team is favored and which team is underdog. 
- You can also place bets over/under on how many points will be scored in a game. 
- Parlays allow you to combine multiple bets into one single bet, and if all individual bets are winners then you win parlay money as well.

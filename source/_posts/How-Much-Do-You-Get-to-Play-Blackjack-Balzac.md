The basics of the game are simple: You’ll be dealt two cards, and you have to decide whether to hit or stand. If your total is 21 or less, you hit; if it’s over 21, you stand. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, kings, queens and jacks are worth 10, and an ace can be either 1 or 11.

If you want to take a chance, you can also choose to double down - in other words, put down another bet equal to your original bet and receive one more card. If you like what you see, you can then stand; but if not, you can still hit.

And if things get really hairy, you can also choose to split your cards - in other words, divide them between two different hands. This move doubles your bet - but again, remember that if things go bad on one hand, you’re stuck with that bad hand!

So how do you win? Essentially, the goal is to beat the dealer - either by getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a blackjack), or by having a total that’s higher than the dealer’s without going over 21.

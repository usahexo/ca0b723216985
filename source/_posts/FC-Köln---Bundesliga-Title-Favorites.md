#  FC Köln - Bundesliga Title Favorites?

When the Bundesliga fixtures were released back in June, there was one fixture that stood out to everyone. FC Köln welcoming Borussia Dortmund to the RheinEnergieStadion on the opening day of the season.

Fast forward to matchday 8 and both teams are sitting at the top of the table with 20 points each. Köln, who were promoted last season, have been one of the surprises of the season so far and look like they could be serious challengers for the Bundesliga title.

Dortmund have been inconsistent this season but still find themselves in a good position as they head into the final stages of the season. They will be looking to get their campaign back on track after their disappointing 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League last week.

It's still very early in the season and there is a long way to go, but FC Köln should definitely be considered as title favourites at this point.

# Christiansen's men make a strong case for themselves in the opening weeks of the season!

The Christiansen's men displayed some serious firepower and impressive defensive organization in the opening weeks of the season. With a 3-0 win over The Hammerheads and a hard-fought 2-1 victory against The Blues, they are looking like a strong contender for the league championship.

The Hammerheads were no match for the sheer power of the Christiansen's men, with strikers Diego Costa, Romelu Lukaku, and Alexis Sanchez wreaking havoc on the defense. The back line of Toby Alderweireld, Vincent Kompany, and David Luiz was impenetrable, holding off wave after wave of attacks from the opposition.

In their match against The Blues, the Christiansen's men showed resilience in coming back from a goal down to win the match. Christian Eriksen was unstoppable in midfield, creating opportunities for his teammates and scoring one goal himself. The defense was solid once again, led by John Terry and Gary Cahill.

It is clear that the Christiansen's men are a force to be reckoned with this season. With so much talent on their team, they are sure to go far.

# 2. FC Köln: Reborn under new Coach

It was a disappointing season for Köln fans last year. The team finished in 12th place and failed to qualify for European football. This poor performance led to the firing of Manager Peter Stöger and the hiring of new Coach Stefan Ruthenbeck.

Ruthenbeck has made a big impact on the team in his short time there. He has installed a more aggressive style of play, which has led to improved results. In his first 10 games in charge, Köln won 5, drew 3, and lost only 2. This has helped them move up to 8th place in the Bundesliga table.

One of the main reasons for the club’s turnaround has been the play of striker Anthony Modeste. After returning from China, where he spent last season on loan, Modeste has scored 9 goals in 10 games under Ruthenbeck.

Köln will look to continue their good form and make a push for Europe this season. With their new Coach and strong striker leading the way, there is no reason why they can’t achieve this goal.

# 3. FC Köln: Europa League Bound?

This season, FC Köln has been one of the surprises in the Bundesliga. The Billy Goats currently sit in seventh place in the table, just six points out of a Europa League spot with nine matches remaining.

Peter Stöger’s side have been led by a number of young players this season, including defenders Jonas Hector and Matthias Lehmann, as well as midfielders Yuya Osako and Leonardo Bittencourt.

Hector has been one of FCK’s best players this season and is currently the second-highest rated player in the Bundesliga, according to WhoScored.com. The 25-year-old defender has played every minute of Köln’s league campaign and already has two goals and four assists to his name.

Lehmann, who captains the club, has also been impressive, playing every minute of Köln’s Europa League campaign so far. The 34-year-old midfielder has scored four goals in all competitions this season.

Osako and Bittencourt have both played well in their first full Bundesliga seasons. Osako, 24, has three goals and three assists in the league, while Bittencourt, 21, has two goals and two assists.

The next few months will be crucial for FCK as they look to finish in the top six or seven and qualify for European football next season. They face some difficult fixtures against teams like Hertha Berlin, Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund but they will be confident of getting good results against the rest of their opponents.

# 4. What Does SP Mean In Sports Betting?

In sports betting, SP stands for the "spread" or the "point spread". This is the number of points by which the favored team is expected to win. Bettors place their bets based on this number. For example, if a team is favored by 10 points, then a bettor would need that team to win by at least 11 points in order to win their bet. If the favored team only wins by 9 points, then the bettor would lose their money.

# 5. FC Köln - Bundesliga Underdogs?

The 2017/2018 Bundesliga season is one of the most open races in recent memory. Heading into the final few weeks of the season, six teams are still in contention for the title. Bayern Munich have a slight edge, but it would be foolish to count out any of the other five contenders.

One of those teams is FC Köln. The Billy Goats have been one of the biggest surprises of the season, and they currently sit in 7th place in the table. They are just two points behind 5th-place Bayer Leverkusen and three points behind 4th-place Eintracht Frankfurt.

Köln's success this season has been largely due to their strong defense. They have conceded just 37 goals in 31 games, which is second only to Bayern Munich. Their goalkeeper Timo Horn has been a huge part of their success, and he recently signed a new contract that will keep him at the club until 2023.

Offensively, Köln have not been quite as successful. They have scored just 39 goals this season, which is tied for 15th in the league. However, they do have a number of exciting young players who could cause problems for opposing defenses over the next few years.

Most people expect Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund to battle it out for first place, but Köln could easily finish in one of the European qualification spots. The Billy Goats will definitely be considered underdogs, but they have proven that they can compete with anyone in the Bundesliga.
